# Creating random interiors in Blender

Sometimes I need to make simple references of buildings or squared-shape structures in order to test generated maps. It is important to actually design these kind of scenes, but I think that you can save some time when generating simple outlines for interiors in a complete random manner.

So I managed to create a simple Python script for Blender that generates some structure outlines by using random cubes & freestyle on the Eevee engine.

# How to use it

NOTE that the script starts by cleaning the whole scene, so make sure to run the code on a new project.

Simply open the Python file on a Text Editor window within Blender & run it! (You can use ALT + P)

Once you run it, press F12 to render an image and you'll get a new result.
